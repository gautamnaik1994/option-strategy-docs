## Getting Started
There are many ways to classify option strategies. Here I have chosen to classify them based in following
- Spread Strategies
- Bullish Strategies
- Bearish Strategies
- Non Directional Strategies
- Calendar Spread Strategies

Each strategy will have multiple tags defined for easier filtering of strategies.
for example: `bullish`, `volatile`, etc
